Title: Breast Cancer Diagnosis 
   * Classification: 0 => T-shirt/top 1 => Trouser 2 => Pullover 3 => Dress 4 => Coat 5 => Sandal 6 => Shirt 7 => Sneaker 8 => Bag 9 => Ankle boot
   * Model-Used: Convolutional Neural Network
   * Initial Accuracy: 
   * Error Encountered: If you have Tensorflow installed and Imported Keras, you will have this error 'module 'tensorflow.compat.v2' has no attribute '__internal__''
   * Error Workaround: Use the Keras from Tensorflow library (Tesorflow-Versio: 2.5.0)
